Created file main.txt
Added content to main.txt
Ran <git init> on git_playground
<git add main.txt>
<git commit>
Created a new repo on github and copied URL
<git remote add origin <URL from github>>
<git push -u origin main>
That's it, the first push to remote is done

<git remote -v> - To check if local repo is linked to remote

<git ls-files> - To show all tracked files

<git diff> - Shows diff b/w files in working dir vs staged

<git log> - To get history of commits
<git log -p> - Shows changes in each commit

<git branch <branch_name>> - To create a branch
<git checkout <branch_name>> - To checkout to a branch
<git checkout -b <branch_name>> - To perform both at once

<git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>> - To push new branch to remote

<git checkout main>
<git merge <branch_name>> - To merge that branch to main.
Generally merging is done via PullRequest on github. We can then pull the latest update from remote via
<git pull> - after checking out to main branch
Don't merge again in local directory

<git branch --merge> - To see the branches merged to main
<git branch --no-merge> - To see branches that aren't merged

<git fetch> - Used to get changes from remote to object database but not to local repo. These changes cannot be viewed directly on main/other branch, instead we can view changes using diff command, like shown below
<git diff main origin/main> 
<git log main..origin/main>
We can also checkout to origin/main and view changes on remote - <git checkout origin/main>
Let's say a commit on remote has changes to main.txt. After <git fetch>, we still can't see those chages in main.txt. We can instead use like
<git diff origin/main -- main.txt>
<git merge origin/main> - If we think the changes are fine and can be merged to main 

<git pull> - Copies all files from remote to local repo
